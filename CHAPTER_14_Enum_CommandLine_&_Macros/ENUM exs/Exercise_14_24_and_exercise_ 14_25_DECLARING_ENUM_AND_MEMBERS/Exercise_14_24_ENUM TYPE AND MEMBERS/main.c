/*
This program will define an enumeration type called FLAGS, having the following members: 

first
second
third
fourth
fifth

NOTE: this enum is not used, therefore MAIN() remains empty; the following exercise (14-25) will define a variable in MAIN()

NOTE: as with STRUCTURES and UNIONS, it is also possible to write: 

typedef enum {first, second, third, fourth, fifth} flags;
